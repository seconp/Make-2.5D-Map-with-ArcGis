Each of these features can be implemented.
This image was obtained from a fixed angle modeled by SketchUp.
The picture is divided into two layers, the bottom layer is the map, and the upper layer is the feature layer. According to the tutorial https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/ 
to write the code. You can search what layer is needed in Google.
Configuration Environment:
Install arpmap and ArcGISserver. You can refer to this URL for installation: https://malagis.com/arcgis-10-5-install-vedio-tutorial.html
Publish the layer to ArcGISserver, using code references.
